# Apache Web-Server
This folder contains the files for the Apache (PHP) Web-server. It also contains the front-end for
the Eagle Eye government officials webpage to login and reply to any problems that are happening
around the city.

# Contributors
The web-server was primarily programmed by Michael Kasman, and some of the PHP server scripts
were also created by Pravat Bhusal.
